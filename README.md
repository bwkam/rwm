# rwm

## A Minimal and Fast X Window Manager.

- For now, this project is heavily based on TinyWM, xwm, and other open source window managers I'll link soon here once I'm finished. But that project is mainly for practicing and learning more about X and xcb.

- If you want to build it, you can just use the `build.sh` script.
